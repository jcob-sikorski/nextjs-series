// Note: nextJS automatically creates that folder when we create the root route

// Note: layout is the UI that is shared between multiple pages 
// in the app - it typically consists of header, content and footer

// Note: you can define a layout by default exporting React 
//       component from layout.tsx
//       That component should accept a children prop that will be 
//       populated with a child page during rendering.

// Note: this particular layout file in the root folder serves as the top-most layout.
//       It is mandatory for all NextJS applications. It's regenerated if deleted.

// Note: when it comes to nested layouts the root layout is rendered first for each page
